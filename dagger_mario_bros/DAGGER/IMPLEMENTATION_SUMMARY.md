# DropoutDAgger Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Successfully created a **complete DropoutDAgger implementation** that extends the existing DAgger system with dropout regularization, supporting all the same observation modes as the original DAgger agent.

## ⚡ What is DropoutDAgger?

DropoutDAgger is an enhanced version of the DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) algorithm that incorporates **dropout regularization** into the neural network architecture. This provides:

- **Better Generalization**: Dropout prevents overfitting to training data
- **Improved Robustness**: More reliable performance on unseen scenarios  
- **Reduced Variance**: More consistent performance across different runs
- **Same Functionality**: All DAgger features preserved with additional robustness

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```

```

## 🎮 Observation Modes Implemented

Just like the regular DAgger system, DropoutDAgger supports:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Full State** | Complete 4-channel observations | Baseline performance |
| **Partial Obs** | Only 2/4 channels (recent frames) | Limited temporal info |
| **Noisy σ=0.1** | Light Gaussian noise | Mild sensor noise |
| **Noisy σ=0.2** | Heavy Gaussian noise | Severe sensor noise |
| **Downsampled** | 42x42 → 84x84 resolution | Lower quality inputs |
