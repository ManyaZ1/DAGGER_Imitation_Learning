# DAGGER_Imitation_Learning
## Intelligent Control â€“ Team Projects 
### 4. Imitation Learning with DAGGER or Privileged Information

**Topics:** Imitation Learning, Dataset Aggregation, Partial Observability

**Description:** Train a policy using demonstrations from an expert with full-state access,
while the policy has only partial or noisy observations (e.g., images or low-dimensional features). Implement DAGGER to iteratively improve the learner. Compare to behavior cloning
and analyze generalization under noise.
