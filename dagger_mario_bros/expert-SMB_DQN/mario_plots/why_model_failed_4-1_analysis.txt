=== Problem Analysis: Why Model Fail on Harder Stages... ===

1. Resolution Issues (84x84 Input)

2. Network Capacity:
   - Only 3 conv layers → limited hierarchical features
   - Single 512-neuron FC layer → insufficient decision complexity

3. Training Stability:
   - High learning rate (5e-5) can cause instability
